## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

With this challenge I am glad I've got to practice more with absolute and relative positioning as they are always taboo subjects that I'm trying to avoid mostly because it was hard to wrap my head around them at first, but it gets easier.
